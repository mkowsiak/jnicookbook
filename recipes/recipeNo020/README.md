# recipe â„– 020 - Passing Java objects into C code

This sample code presents how to pass Java object. In this sample I pass object of type `CustomClass` that contains both, primitive types and object of type `OtherClass`.

    package recipeNo020.redux;
    public class CustomClass {
        public int        iVal;
        public double     dVal;
        public char       cVal;
        public boolean    bVal;
        public OtherClass oVal; -+
        public String     sVal;  |
    }                            |
                                 |
    package recipeNo020.redux;   |
    public class OtherClass {  <-+
        public String sVal;
    }

# To compile the code run

    make clean
    make 
    make test
