# recipe â„– 073 - Passing errno and errno string inside wrapper class

This time we pass `errno` together with the value that is a result of `JNI` call (`java.lang.String`); As we can't return multiple objects, we are passing value wrapped inside `ErrnoWrapper`. `ErrnoWrapper` class is quite simple and contains:

```
public class ErrnoWrapper {

  // placeholder for errno generated by system call
  private int    errnoCode    = 0;

  // plaveholder for errno related description
  private String errnoStr     = null;

  // placeholder for the result of call to JNI
  private Object result       = null;
}
```

This sample illustrates how to return `errno` all together with the actual result of `JNI` call.

# Building and running
